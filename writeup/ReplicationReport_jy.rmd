# Introduction
## Justification for experiment
This study examines structural brain changes in young adult cannabis users in a longitudinal design. This study is pertinent to my research interests because I will be studying structural-functional relationships in adolescent brain development using similar neuroimaging methods. It will be beneficial to have experience with this structural processing pipeline and with SPM software.

## Description of paper
The study by Koenders et al. examined whether structural brain changes were associated with substance use (focusing on cannabis) over a three-year period. The participants of the study were young adult users and matched healthy controls. The study used a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique called voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to measure grey matter volume (GMV) changes. They assessed drug usage with questionnaires for nicotine, alcohol, and cannabis usage. 

I aim to replicate the study’s finding of significant cerebellar differences between users and healthy controls at baseline using the authors’ voxel-based morphometry pipeline and a two-sample t-test.

## Description of stimuli and procedures
I will be using the subject T1-weighted MRI baseline and follow-up scan data from OpenNeuro. (https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds000174/versions/1.0.1). SPM8 software will be used to conduct voxel-based morphometry analysis (using VBM8 of SPM).

## VBM Procedure Overview:

1. Segmentation of T1w data into grey matter and white matter
2. Grey matter normalization using DARTEL
3. Voxel smoothing
4. Statistical analysis

## Anticipated Challenges
- Reproducing the VBM pipeline steps when explicit parameter values are not listed
- Possible software incompatability with SPM8
- May need to use SPM12 instead of SPM8

## Methods

### Planned Sample

The sample for this pipeline reproduction consists of heavy cannabis users (CB,n=20, age baseline M=20.5, SD=2.1) and non-cannabis using healthy controls (HC,n=22 age baseline M=21.6, SD=2.45). T1-weighted MRI data comes from OpenNeuro.org.

### Materials
The materials required for this VBM pipeline reproduction are 1) the MRI dataset and 2) neuroimaging processing software. Both are available online and summarized below:

1. MRI dataset - 3T structural MRI scans were downloaded from OpenNeuro with the parameters as follows: T1 turbo field echo, TR 9.6 s, TE 4.6 s, 182 slices, slice thickness 1.2 mm, FOV 256x256 mm, in-plane resolution 256x256mm, flip angle 8°. See Links section for OpenNeuro source.

2. SPM software - the pipeline will be run in SPM8 (Structural Brain Mapping Group), specifically employing the VBM-8 module. SPM requires Matlab.

**Replication study differences:**
Dependent on software compatability, SPM12 may be used instead of SPM8.

### Procedure	
**Voxel-based morphometry**  
*Quoted from study:*
"For both the cross-sectional and the longitudinal analyses, we used the VBM-8 module of
the software package SPM (Structural Brain Mapping Group, University of Jena, Germany,
http://dbm.neuro.uni-jena.de/vbm8). For the cross-sectional analyses, at baseline and followup,
individual T1 images were first aligned to a T1 template in MNI-space (Montreal Neurological Institute) and subsequently segmented into grey matter, white matter and cerebro-
spinal fluid. The resulting grey matter was normalized using the diffeomorphic image registration
algorithm (DARTEL) [33]. Grey matter images were modulated with the nonlinear
transformation parameters as computed during the normalization procedures. The resulting
images contain the volume proportion of probabilistically assigned grey matter tissue for
each voxel. These grey matter tissue probability images were visually inspected again and
finally smoothed with an 8-mm Gaussian kernel. Note that each image of the regional grey
matter volume was corrected for individual brain size, since this step is part of the VBM8
toolbox routine."

**ROIs**  
The study examined specific regions of interest (ROIs) that were based on previous cross-sectional findings. They were anatomically defined using the Nielsen and Hansen’s volume of interest online database. The ROIs were the: OFC, ACC, insula, striatum, thalamus, amygdala, hippocampus and cerebellum

**Replication Study Differences:**  
SPM12 may be used for the VBM processing pipeline instead of SPM8 due to possible incompatabilities of the older SPM8 / VBM-8 module and the current version of Matlab 2019a. If SPM12 is employed, the CAT12 VBM module will be used instead of VBM-8.

This replication will focus on the cerebellum ROI as it was the primary baseline finding.

### Analysis of VBM Data

The key analysis of interest is a two-sample t-test of the grey matter volumes at baseline between the cannabis users group and the healthy control group. The result of interest is a significant difference of GMV located at the cerebellum between users and controls.

In addition to the two-sample t-test, I will check the cerebellar ROI's grey matter volumes for normality.

Significance was defined as follows:
"For all analyses, we first performed region of interest ROI analyses, where structural differences within ROI masks were considered significant if p < .001, with an FWE-corrected cluster probability of p < .05 adjusted for the small search volume [36].

### Differences from Original Study

The main difference between this pipeline reproduction and the original study is the possible usage of SPM12. This possibility is not likely as it should be straightforward to resolve incompatabilities by using an older version of Matlab (e.g. one released around SPM8 like R2014b).

## Results

### VBM Preprocessing

### **10/27/2019 - Status Update**

*CAT12 pipeline: VBM preprocessing completed using Matlab 2019b on MacOS 10.15. Preparing for statistical analysis.*

*VBM8 pipeline: tissue segmentation completed using Matlab 2014a Windows 10. Undergoing visual inspection and then smoothing.*

Segmentation and rigid-body spatial registration to the DARTEL template has been carried out on all subjects using SPM12 CAT12. Partial volume estimates, grey matter, and white matter images are displayed in Figures 1-4. This took 26 processing hours, running in parallel. Logs are located in the *spm_logs* directory. Images were visually inspected for quality control (examining accuracy of tissue separation and other artifacts). Total intracranial volume (TIV) was estimated for each subject followed by spatial smoothing using an 8mm Gaussian kernel. 

The original study's methods do not work using MacOS 10.15, even when accomodating for old Matlab versions (2014a). They do run in Windows 10, so currently the "true" replication is being carried on a Windows 10 computer running Matlab 2014a and using SPM8/VBM8 toolbox. Segmentation has been completed using this VBM8 pipeline.

I will try to complete both pipelines and see how they compare to the original study's findings.

### **11/16/2019 - Status Update**
*Overall, the processing has been completed but I have been unable to replicate the findings.*

Both the new (CAT12) and original (VBM8) processing pipelines have been completed. All imaging data has been processed up to the 8mm kernel smoothing stage (see Fig.5) and has undergone statistical analysis. 

![Fig.5 Example of a smoothed grey matter image using an 8mm kernel.](../images/320_smoothed.png)

The statistical analysis is conducted by setting up a statistical model using SPM's GLM tool (Fig. 6), and then defining the contrasts of the two-sample t test (in this case users > ctrl or users < ctrl). I was able to set up and analyze the data following the author's methods and also using the tool's official documentation. I set total intracranial volume (TIV) as a covariate similar to the authors.

![Fig.6 Statistical Analysis Design Matrix - CAT12](../images/t_test_design_tiv.png)

No significant clusters appeared in either contrast when controlling for multiple comparisons (FWE @ 0.05). This was true for both pipelines. The two figures below show the results of the analysis for the two contrasts, when using the modern CAT12 pipeline. The original VBM8 looks similar.

I had to remove all statistical thresholds (no multiple comparisons corrections) and cluster size thresholds (clusters can be very small) to get some regions to appear. I also entered the coordinates of the key finding (the larger cerebellum grey matter volume in users at baseline [26,-70,-20]) and did not observe any GMV differences.

![Fig.8 Users < Ctrl - CAT12](../images/users_less_ctrl_uncorr.png)

*Current steps*

Although I followed the data processing instructions as indicated, I am going through both pipelines again. I suspect there may have been a missed step in the initial segmentation because there are multiple parameters and smaller steps wrapped into a single batch process. Another possibility is that the statistical analysis may have been incorrectly entered.

## Discussion

### Summary of Replication Attempt

Open the discussion section with a paragraph summarizing the primary result from the confirmatory analysis and the assessment of whether it replicated, partially replicated, or failed to replicate the original result.  

### Commentary

Add open-ended commentary (if any) reflecting (a) insights from follow-up exploratory analysis, (b) assessment of the meaning of the replication (or not) - e.g., for a failure to replicate, are the differences between original and present study ones that definitely, plausibly, or are unlikely to have been moderators of the result, and (c) discussion of any objections or challenges raised by the current and original authors about the replication attempt.  None of these need to be long.
